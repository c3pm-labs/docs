title: About C3PM
---

[C3PM](https://c3pm.io) is a next-generation package manager for [C++](https://isocpp.org).

You can use C3PM to share and use packages with other developers around the world.

C3PM is composed of three main components:

* The website
* The Command Line Interface (CLI)
* The registry

You can use the website to discover packages and manage your own.

The CLI can be ran from your terminal, and is your main way of interacting with C3PM.

The registry holds the code and metadata of all packages shared via C3PM.

## Getting started

To get started with C, you can create an account on the platform.

Once your account is set up, use the command line interface (CLI) to [install C3PM](getting_started/install).
