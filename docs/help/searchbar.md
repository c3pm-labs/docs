## Filtering

You can filter you result by `tag` and `author`.
You can chain the filters.

If you want to filter by multiple tag or author you have to repeat the filter as many times as you have values.

The format is: `<field>:<value>`, where `field` can be `tag` or `author`.

Examples: `tag:utils` `author:superdev`

## Sorting

You can sort you result by `downloads` and `name`. Your sorting can be ascendant or descendant.

The format is: `sort:<property>-<order>`, where `order` can be `asc` or `desc`.

Example: `sort:downloads-asc` `sort:downloads-desc`
